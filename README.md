# The Fashion Post - Project Exam 1 

![image](/images/screenshot-homepage-pe1.jpg)

This is the first project exam at Noroff where I would use the skills I had learnt during my first year to build a blog of my own choosing. I created a blog called The Fashion Post, geared towards young women interested in fashion and lifestyle content.
